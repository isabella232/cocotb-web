        <p>
          cocotb works with any hardware design that your
          preferred simulator (and cocotb
          <a href="https://docs.cocotb.org/en/stable/simulator_support.html">supports all major simulators</a>)
          can simulate &ndash; be it in (System)Verilog, VHDL, a mixed language,
          or even a mixed-signal design!

        <p>
          With cocotb, you write testbenches and verification code in Python.
          In addition to all the goodies of the Python programming language and
          its ecosystem, cocotb provides
          <a href="https://docs.cocotb.org/en/stable/writing_testbenches.html">
            a lean framework to efficiently write verification code

        <p>
          Running a test has never been easier thanks to cocotb's built-in test
          runner with CI integration. Alternatively, you can integrate cocotb
          easily with your existing build and reporting system.

    <h1 class="text-center">Key benefits</h1>
    <p>
      cocotb is all about verification productivity. Verification is software, and
      by writing verification code in Python, verification engineers have access
      to all the goodness that made software development productive and enjoyable.
      It allows developers to focus on the verification task itself, and stop
      fighting with language limitations.

          <p>
            cocotb
            <a href="https://docs.cocotb.org/en/stable/simulator_support.html">works with all commonly used RTL simulators</a>:
            VCS, ModelSim and Questa, Xcelium, Riviera-PRO and Active-HDL,
            GHDL, CVC, Verilator and Icarus Verilog on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
            If your simulator of choice can simulate your RTL design, cocotb can
            verify it! cocotb is just a library, integrate it with your existing
            project automation.

            Verification is all about productivity. With cocotb, your testbench
            can make use of the whole Python ecosystem:
            <a href="https://pypi.org/">over 350,000 extension packages</a>,

          <p>
            With cocotb, interfacing with existing infrastructure is easy.
            Do you want to talk to a golden model in your testbench? Or to real
            hardware, e.g. an FPGA or a logic analyzer? In most cases, that's
            just a matter of looking for existing Python bindings&mdash;like

          <p>
            Are you tired of writing custom test runner tooling? With cocotb,
            tests are automatically discovered and run. No more need for
            custom runners.
            The cocotb test runner by default produces regression results in
            the industry-standard Junit XML format, which is understood by
            most CI solutions, such as Jenkins, or Azure Pipelines.

            With cocotb, you can grow as you go. You only need to learn a handful
            of conventions and you're ready to go. There is no mandatory
            methodology or class structure to get started!

          <p>
            cocotb is a true and independent open source project, developed by a
            loosely connected community of like-minded engineers which we
            collectively call the <em>cocotb contributors</em>. Everybody can be
            a cocotb contributor: we value providing support for other users, bug
            reports, feature requests, and improvements to our documentation just
            as much as we value code changes or help with releasing and
            maintaining cocotb. All development and decision making happens
            <a href="https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb">in the open on GitHub</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cocotb source code licensing provides a level playing field for
            all. cocotb is licensed under a permissive BSD license with no
            Contributor License Agreement (CLA) or other copyright assignment
            mechanisms in place: every individual and every company can use and
            contribute to cocotb under the same terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            The development of cocotb is coordinated by a group of experienced
            volunteers, the
            <a href="https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#maintainers"><em>cocotb maintainers</em></a>.
            Think of maintainers as the caretakers of the cocotb project: they
            create releases, review and approve code changes in pull requests,
            and often also do a fair amount of development.
          </p>

            cocotb is a project of the
            <a href="https://www.fossi-foundation.org">FOSSi Foundation</a>, a
            UK-based not-for-profit, which provides legal, administrative, and

            the cocotb project is taking.
